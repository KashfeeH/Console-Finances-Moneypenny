# Module 4: Console-Finances-Moneypenny

## Description

Even though the Boot camp is closed for Christmas and new year holidays, Module 4 challenge was to use the JavaScript we have learnt and create a file that
analyses financial data. While doing this assignment, I found that I need a lot more practise with JavaScript. Since I am very much into Web Motion, JavaScript eventually will be
my bread and butter. I must say it is not difficult but I simply lack the knowledge and experience to think about the ways a problem could be solved and why a cope snippet is acting the way it does. 

##  Usage
To see the result of the JavaScript, please navigate to https://kashfeeh.github.io/Console-Finances-Moneypenny/
Click inspect and find the console tab for the analysis.
